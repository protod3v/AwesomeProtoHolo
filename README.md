## üîì Liberating Your Proto (Hardware Hacking)

This section provides a guide to freeing your Proto hologram from proprietary software using a Linux-based approach.  **Proceed with caution! Hardware modifications may void your warranty.**


### LIBERATE.md Steps


1. **Boot from Linux Live USB:**

    * Create a bootable USB drive with a Linux distribution like Kali or Ubuntu.
    * Force your Proto's boot menu (usually by pressing F2 or Del during startup).
    * Select the USB drive to boot from Linux.


2. **Reconnaissance:**

    * Mount the Windows partition (replace `/dev/sdaX` with the correct partition, which you can find using tools like `lsblk` in your Linux environment):

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /mnt/windows
    sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/windows 
    ```

    * Gather hardware information:

    ```bash
    lsusb -v > hardware_info.txt
    lspci -v >> hardware_info.txt
    ```

    * Copy the ProtoHologram drivers and configuration files (adjust the path if the installation directory is different):

    ```bash
    cd /mnt/windows/Program\ Files/ProtoHologram/
    cp -r drivers/ configs/ ~/research/
    ```

3. **Initial Python Script (`proto_pwner.py`):**

    This is a starting point for controlling the Proto from Python:

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/python
    # proto_pwner.py

    import serial
    import time

    class HologramHijacker:
        def __init__(self):
            self.port = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0')  # **IMPORTANT:** Verify the correct serial port. Use `dmesg | grep tty` after plugging in the USB controller to find the correct device path.

        def control_display(self):
            # Implementation for controlling the display (requires reverse engineering or finding Linux-compatible drivers).
            # Use the extracted drivers and configs from the Windows system.
            pass  # Replace with actual control logic

        def control_motor(self):
            # Implementation for controlling the motor (speed and timing).
            pass  # Replace with actual control logic

    # Example usage:
    hijacker = HologramHijacker()
    hijacker.control_display()
    ```

### Next Steps (Liberation)

* **Identify the Correct Serial Port:** Crucial for communication.  Use `dmesg | grep tty`.
* **Driver Integration:** Reverse engineer or find Linux-compatible drivers for the `control_display` and `control_motor` functions.
* **Protocol Analysis:** Use tools like Wireshark to analyze communication between the original software and the Proto to understand the control protocol.
* **Testing:** Rigorous testing is essential.
* **Documentation:** Document the process clearly in [LIBERATE.md](LIBERATE.md) (which could be a separate file or a section within the main README).

## üåü Understanding the Proto

### Core Principles

The Proto hologram device operates on the principle of persistence of vision, using a high-speed LED array and precise motor control.

1. **Hardware Components:** High-density LED array, precision stepper motor, motor control and timing circuit, video processing unit, power management system.
2. **Operating Mechanism:** Input Video/Image ‚Üí Frame Processing ‚Üí LED Array Mapping ‚Üí Synchronized Motor Rotation ‚Üí Persistence of Vision Display
3. **Signal Flow:** Video input processed, frames mapped to LED states, precise motor timing, sync pulses for alignment, power management for consistent brightness.

### Technical Specifications

* **Resolution:** 256 vertical pixels per rotation
* **Frame Rate:** 30Hz standard (modifiable with hardware mods - see below)
* **Input:** HDMI or USB
* **Power:** 100-240VAC, 50/60Hz, 700W
* **Dimensions:** 88"H x 23.6"W x 50"L
* **Weight:** 410lbs



## üöÄ OpenProtoHolo Software

This section details our open-source tools for enhanced Proto control.

### Installation

```bash
pip install openprotoholo  # Install the core library
```

### Quick Start (Python)

```python
from openprotoholo import ProtoDevice

proto = ProtoDevice()
proto.connect()
proto.display_pattern("test_pattern")
```
