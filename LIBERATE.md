## Project: Proto-Freedom (Open-Source Proto Hologram Controller)

**Goal:** Liberate Proto hologram displays from proprietary software.

**Steps:**

1. **Boot from Linux Live USB:**

    ```bash
    # Create bootable USB with Kali or Ubuntu
    # Force boot menu (F2/Del key - varies by system)
    # Boot from USB
    ```

2. **Reconnaissance:**

    ```bash
    # Mount Windows partition (replace /dev/sdaX with the correct partition)
    sudo mkdir /mnt/windows
    sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/windows

    # Grab hardware info
    lsusb -v > hardware_info.txt
    lspci -v >> hardware_info.txt

    # Snoop their files (adjust path if necessary)
    cd /mnt/windows/Program\ Files/ProtoHologram/
    cp -r drivers/ configs/ ~/research/
    ```

3. **Quick & Dirty Python Script:**

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/python
    # proto_pwner.py

    import serial
    import time

    class HologramHijacker:
        def __init__(self):
            self.port = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0') # Verify the correct port

        def control_display(self):
            # Use their drivers (requires further implementation)
            pass

        def control_motor(self):
            # Speed + timing (requires further implementation)
            pass


    # Example usage:
    hijacker = HologramHijacker()
    hijacker.control_display() # Example function call
    ```

4. **GitHub Repository:**

**Next Steps:**

* **Identify the correct serial port:**  The script assumes `/dev/ttyUSB0`. Verify this.  Use `dmesg | grep tty` after plugging in the USB controller to identify the correct device.
* **Driver Integration:** The core task is integrating the extracted Windows drivers into the Python script. This will likely involve reverse-engineering the driver functionality or finding compatible Linux drivers.  Provide the specific driver names for more targeted assistance.
* **Protocol Analysis:** Analyze the communication between the original application and the device to understand the control protocol. This might involve using Wireshark or similar tools.
* **Testing:**  Rigorous testing will be essential. Start with simple commands and gradually increase complexity.
* **Documentation:** Clearly document the setup, installation, and usage within the repository's README.


Providing more details about the drivers (names, functionality) and any communication logs you can capture will greatly assist in developing the `control_display` and `control_motor` functions.
